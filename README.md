# Second-PCB-attempt

well here we go my second attempt of creating PCB of mechanical keyboard

I supposed we'll call it a numpad board? well because it only consists of 17 MX only hotswap switches (finally using matrix yeay!!)

this time on my second attempt I tried to include a rotary encoder so that you use to control volume on your pc, scroll up or down and many more!
also I included an 9.1 OLED LCD display why? I believe the right term to desribe it is just for "fun" :D
well you can use the LCD display to display the capslock on or just to display silly small pictures on your numpad board.

This version is still not fixed, might change more in the future because Im still not happy with the componen placements.
Again, my priority is AESTHETIC of the PCB sooo it takes me such a loonnggggggg time to design this.

Pros

-HOTSWAPABLE!!!!!!

-rotary encoder

-OLED LCD display

Cons

-no RGB :(
